# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO "Watch Out: Meteors!"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO it's going to be a game that is based off of flappy bird. There will be a spaceship involved that avoids meteors going to avoid meteors. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO My software will use the up and down arrow key to avoid the meteors that will come towards the ship. I was considering making it speed up. Most of the tutorials I've seen make it on scratch, but I may find another way to make it. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO No matter what I will have a spaceship that will avoid meteors. There will be a space like wallpaper. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO A better outcome would be where the spaceship kinda moves up and down, almost like it's trying to constantly stabilize itself. The speef of the spaceship will go faster from then on. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO spaceship that goes up and down, speeds up towards the meteors, uses the up and down arrow keys.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO I will need to learn a new coding languag and become familiar with it so that I can add the the speed and the floating spaceship.
